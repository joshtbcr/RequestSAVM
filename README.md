# RequestSAVM

This is a dummy extension I created just to learn how Chrome extensions work. I wanted to automate something, so I automated 3 every-day clicks, saving 1 minute per day or 17 hours per year.

## Setup

1) Download the source code.
2) Go to Chrome extensions: Put this URL chrome://extensions/
3) Toggle Developer mode on right upper corner.
4) Click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder with the source code.

## Usage

1) Click on the extension icon on the right upper corner (Scream icon).
(Wait


## Limitations

It will only work for new VMs. If there is already a VM requested, it will fail to download it. 

Anytime the Front End code (React) is changed by the team, it will likely break it. :')
